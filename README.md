# customer-data-consent
This project is a web application built with Flask, a Python web framework, that allows you to monitor and improve the standardization of customer consent data. The goal of this service is to ensure that customer data is accurately collected, stored, and shared across different systems and platforms.

Usage
To use the web app, simply run the following command:

```
python app.py
```

This will start the Flask server and launch the web app. You can then access the app by navigating to http://localhost:5000 in your web browser.

Once you're in the app, you can enter customer consent data to be checked. The app will then validate the data against a set of predefined rules and provide feedback on any errors or inconsistencies detected.
