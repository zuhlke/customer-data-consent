# customer-data-consent
This project is a web application built with Flask, a Python web framework, that allows you to monitor and improve the standardization of customer consent data. The goal of this service is to ensure that customer data is accurately collected, stored, and shared across different systems and platforms.

Installation
To use this web app, you'll need to clone the repository and install any necessary dependencies. You can do this by running the following commands:


'git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
cd yourproject
pip install -r requirements.txt'

Usage
To use the web app, simply run the following command:
'python app.py'

This will start the Flask server and launch the web app. You can then access the app by navigating to http://localhost:5000 in your web browser.

Once you're in the app, you can enter customer consent data to be checked. The app will then validate the data against a set of predefined rules and provide feedback on any errors or inconsistencies detected. You can also export the validated data to a CSV file for further analysis.
